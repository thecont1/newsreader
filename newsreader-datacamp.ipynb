If you've already worked with APIs before, or if you completed my [Introduction to APIs in Python course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-apis-in-python), none of this should be new. For those of you who have never worked with APIs before or have limited experience, this is a useful refresher and will make following along with the rest of the code-along a lot easier.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>What is an API?</summary> \n  <p>\n\nAPIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, are like the messengers of the digital world, making sure apps, devices, and services can talk to each other smoothly. They let different systems share data and perform actions without getting tangled in each other’s code. You might not notice it, but APIs are behind almost everything we do digitally. Plug in your electric car, and an API’s handling the data exchange with the charger. Check the weather or get an email on your phone? That’s thanks to APIs pulling and delivering data from online sources to your device.\n\nIn essence, APIs make life easier for both developers and users, setting the rules for how apps communicate and what they can share. Whether it’s streaming music, ordering food, or tracking fitness, APIs keep it all connected. They’re one of the most powerful, behind-the-scenes technologies that make our digital world feel effortless, despite being complex and varied under the hood.\n   </p>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>REST APIs</summary> \n  <p>\n\nAPIs come in many different styles and flavors, but for the purpose of this code-along, we will be focusing on REST APIs. REST APIs let two systems communicate over the internet, using HTTP, the same protocol your browser uses to load webpages. Think of it like typing a website address into your browser: you send a request, and the page loads in response. \n\nWith rest APIs, the system that sends the request is called **the client**, the system the receives the request and returns a response is usually **the server**. \n\n![Request response cycle](resources/request-response-cycle.png)\n   </p>\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>HTTP Verbs</summary> \n  <p>\n\nREST APIs are based on HTTP verbs. These describe the action the client wishes to perform on a resource on server. In total there are 9 HTTP verbs, in practice you'll be using the 4 most common verbs described in the table below.\n\n| Verb   | Action |\n|-|-|\n| `GET`    | Reading a resource |\n| `POST`   | Create a new resource |\n| `PUT`    | Update an existing resource |\n| `DELETE` | Delete a resource |\n   </p>\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>URLs and parameters</summary> \n  <p>\n\n![Structure of URLs](resources/url-structure.png)\n\nA REST API is accessible over the internet through a URL, which acts like an address that points to a specific resource on the server. This URL includes several parts, as shown in the image: the protocol (http://), the server’s domain (350.5th-ave.com), the port number (like :80), the path to the specific resource (e.g., /unit/243), and optional query parameters (e.g., ?floor=77).\n\nWhen interacting with REST APIs, you’ll often need to include additional information, like filters or specific search terms, to get exactly the data you want. This extra information is usually passed as query parameters in the URL. These parameters help refine your request to retrieve more specific data, making the API flexible and responsive to a wide range of needs.\n   </p>\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Headers</summary> \n  <p>\n\nHeaders carry additional information about the request or response, providing context for how the message should be processed. They can specify how the authenticate or what the content type is that's being sent. Headers essentially help the server and client understand the message’s format and how to handle it. Each header is a key-value pair, written as `Key: Value`, where the key is case-insensitive.\n   </p>\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Response status codes</summary> \n  <p>\n\nThere are over 70 HTTP status codes, grouped into five main categories. These categories help us quickly understand the nature of the response. Codes starting with 1XX are informational, 2XX indicate success, 3XX handle redirections, 4XX signal client-side errors, and 5XX point to server-side issues.\n\nAmong these, three key codes to remember are:\n- `200` **OK**: The request was successful, and the server returned the expected data.\n- `404` **Not Found**: The server couldn’t find the requested resource.\n- `500` **Internal Server Error**: Something went wrong on the server’s side, causing the request to fail.\n\n   </p>\n</details>","metadata":{},"id":"22f927f0-d46c-4c81-822a-b74959d88873","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Overview\n\n![Code along schema](resources/code-along-schema.png)\n\n## Task 0: Preparing your workbook\n\nBefore we can get started talking to our APIs, we first need to configure our workbook so it has access to all the information it needs to talk to the APIs we plan to use. This involves setting up and loading environment variables in your DataLab workbook.\n\n## Task 1: Fetching new headlines from NewsAPI\nOnce all set-up is done, we start by fetching the most recent news headlines from the newsapi.org API. Using API key authantication via URL parameters we can securely retrieve the latest headlines and store them in a variable for later use.\n\n## Task 2: Fetching weather data from Meteosource\nNow we can move on to using the meteosource API to get the weather forecast for our location. We'll first need to find the `place_id` for our location before we can fetch the forecast so we'll need to make 2 API requests here in order to get the job done. For meteosource.com we'll also use API-key authentication but this time we'll send the API key via the headers instead of URL parameters.\n\n## Task 3: Using OpenAI completions API to generate the \"morning update\"\nOnce we have retrieved all information from the newapi.org and meteosource.com APIs, we can now use OpenAI completions API (which is the API version of ChatGPT) to generate a nice and engaging \"morning update\" message. The API we'll be using here uses the POST http verb so we'll need to adjust the `requests` functions we are using and also tweak the function arguments.\n\n## Task 4: Generate an MP3 using OpenAI text-to-speech API\nFinally, once we have generated a message, we can now use the text-to-speech API from OpenAI to generate an audio stream using our voice of preference. We'll save the stream locally to an .mp3 file which we can then download and play.","metadata":{},"id":"7cffc4e6-9f1d-4480-8a2c-69bdc9146cb2","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Code-along","metadata":{},"id":"c1a1a99d-cd0a-4fd0-9b1f-d7b8b92b694f","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Task 0: Preparing your workbook \n\n### Packages used\n\nFor this code-along we will be using the `os` and `requests` packages.

So, if you had any outdoor plans, it might be best to have a backup buffet inside. We’re looking at temperatures dropping to a cool 14 degrees Celsius—perfect for cozy sweaters and cozy vibes!\n\nNow, let’s dive into the morning headlines, shall we? \n\nFirst up, in sports news, the NFL has given us a blockbuster! Josh Allen’s late touchdown run lifted the Bills over the Chiefs, handing Kansas City their first loss of the season. It was like watching a heavyweight showdown at the circus—full of drama, excitement, and a whole lot of popcorn flying around! \n\nIn a twist that feels like it belongs in a sitcom, the New York Giants have benched quarterback Daniel Jones, turning to Tommy DeVito instead. Who knew the NFL was into musical chairs this season? If this football franchise were a reality show, they’d definitely win Best Drama.\n\nSwitching gears to some less humorous news, we have an E. coli outbreak linked to organic carrots that has left one dead and dozens ill across the U.S. Remember, if your carrots are starting to look suspicious, maybe just stick to the good ol’ regular ones! \n\nIn entertainment, we’ve got some star-studded news.

Prepare for a crossover episode that’s probably going to change television as we know it!\n\nMeanwhile, Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski from ‘Morning Joe’ decided it was time to pay President-Elect Donald Trump a visit after seven years. Apparently, it’s time to shake things up—just like a good cocktail, maybe with a little lemon twist... or a lot!\n\nIn a more serious note, Pope Francis is calling for an investigation into potential genocide in Gaza. This isn’t something you see every day. It’s a heavy topic but definitely one that needs our attention.\n\nEver wondered what Earth looked like 400 million years ago? Well, scientists now say we may have had a Saturn-like ring back then, possibly made of a broken asteroid! Talk about a cosmological fashion statement! Who knew our planet had such a flair for the dramatic?\n\nAnd rounding off our headlines, Beyoncé is set to take the NFL halftime stage on Christmas Day. Get ready for what’s bound to be the best reason to not leave the couch during the holidays. I know I’ll be skipping the mashed potatoes for some serious Bey time! \n\nSo, as you sip that coffee and brace yourself for whatever today throws at you, just remember: life is like a series of headlines—sometimes serious, sometimes funny, but always a little unpredictable. Keep smiling and have a fantastic day ahead!\n"}]},{"source":"<details>\n  <summary>Code hints</summary> \n  <p>\n\n- The OpenAI chat completions API requires a `POST` request to be sent, the `requests` Python package has functions for each of the HTTP verbs, such as `requests.get()` or `requests.put()`.\n- `POST` requests require a \"payload\" of data to be sent to the API.
